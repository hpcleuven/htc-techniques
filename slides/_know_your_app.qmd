## Step 1. Representative Case

- Define a representative case
  (keep domain size, particles, protein size, genome size)
- Runtime of +/- minutes
  (reduced timesteps)

Resource considerations

- Serial vs parallel code
  if parallel, MPI? OpenMP? or hybrid?
- CPU or GPU needed
- max memory needed
- I/O pattern and storage request
