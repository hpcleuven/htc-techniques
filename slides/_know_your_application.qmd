# Know your application


## Step 1: single case

- Pick one case/example
- Should represent your production run
  (domain size, number of particles, protein size etc)
- Runs reasonably short (e.g. minutes)
  (take less iterations or timesteps)
- benchmark this specific case
  - CPU: num processes/threads
